# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## The Problem You Had
- ❌ `streamlit: command not found` 
- ❌ API key errors in DFT Error Fixer
- ❌ Changes not applying to the app

## ✅ The Solution

### 1. **Easy Way to Run (Recommended)**
```bash
# Basic version (no AI features)
./launch.sh

# Full version with AI features
./launch.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

### 2. **Get Your API Key**
1. Go to [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Copy your API key (starts with `gsk_`)

### 3. **Test Your Setup**
```bash
# Test if API key works
python3 test_api_key.py YOUR_API_KEY

# Run the app
./launch.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

## 🔧 What I Fixed

1. **PATH Issue**: Added streamlit to PATH in launcher scripts
2. **API Key Loading**: App now loads `.env` file automatically  
3. **Error Handling**: Shows helpful warnings when API key is missing
4. **Easy Launcher**: Created `./launch.sh` for one-command startup

## 🎯 Now You Can

- ✅ Run the app without PATH issues
- ✅ Use DFT Error Fixer with AI
- ✅ Get helpful error messages
- ✅ Test API keys before running

## 🚨 If You Still Get Errors

1. **"command not found"**: Use `./launch.sh` instead of `streamlit run`
2. **"Invalid API Key"**: Get a real key from Groq console
3. **"Port in use"**: Wait a moment or use different port

**The app is now working!** 🎉
